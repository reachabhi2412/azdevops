1. Apply PodService.yaml on your cluster https://github.com/reachabhi2412/azdevops/blob/main/Azure/PodService.yaml

2. This will create expose the service over Public IP Address. Check Services on tportal and look for the service and its Public IP

3. Access the IP over http. You would seee an nginx page

4. On Azure Portal , go to Public IP Address from Global search and find the above IP address as well as its resource Group

5. Update the IP address with a domain name using below command. Below is an example
az network public-ip update --resource-group MC_myTFResourceGroup_myAKS_centralindia --name kubernetes-a9e62b1504a274eb389bf250dcee5a54 --dns-name myapp 
6. You can check the IP address resource on Azure Portal and check the DNS updated on the Overview page as -  myapp.<REGION>.cloudapp.azure.com 
eg: myapp.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com

7. Now access this DNS over http://myapp.centralindia.cloudapp.azure.com and you should be able to see the same nginx page
